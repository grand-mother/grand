# GRANDLIB env with conda

## Frequent confusion

The conda environment **does not contain GRANDLIB code**. The conda environment installs the necessary libraries, executables, initializes environment variables to correctly compile the C part of GRANLIB (gull and turtle), please [constraints to use grandlib](https://github.com/grand-mother/grand/wiki#constraints-to-use-grandlib) in GRANDLIB wiki.

## WARNING

 * A wifi connection is not recommended for this installation
 * GRANDLIB conda environnement is only available with **amd64 architecture**, for arm64 work in progress. 

## miniconda installation

You need to have conda command installed, the minimal package to have it is miniconda. The [page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install miniconda

## Some conda commands

* udpdate conda version

```
conda update conda
```

* list of available user environments

```
conda env list
```

* open/activate user environments

```
conda activate <my_env>
```

* close/deactivate user environments

```
conda deactivate
```

## Import GRANDLIB environnement for amd64 processor architecture

Start by update your conda and create the GRANDLIB environnement with file conf defined in grand/env/conda 

```
conda env create -n grandlib --file grandlib_amd64.yml
conda activate grandlib
```



Initialize GRANDLIB package and GULL/TURTLE compilation, in 
the root package, first clone the package grand

```
git clone https://github.com/grand-mother/grand.git
cd grand
source env/setup.sh
```

Finally launch tests suite package to

```
python -m pip install -r quality/requirements.txt
grand_quality_test_cov.bash
```
