; and [paths] is a list of paths to search in the repository
; If credentials are required to access the repository, they should be given in the [credential] section using the same name

; This section allows you to specify your login and optionally a key file to access repositories or connect database though an ssh tunnel etc...
; For security reasons you will not be allowed to provide sensitive information as password in this file.
; If password is required (e.g. to decrypt the key file) it will be asked interactively.
; For ssh protocol, it's highly encouraged to use an ssh-agent (to avoid to have to provide passwd interactively at each run)
; To run an ssh-agent just do : `eval $(ssh-agent)` and `ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa`
