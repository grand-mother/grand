;Local directories where data should be found.
;If data is not found in local directories but found in a repository,
; it will be copied in the first localdir of the list (e.g. .incoming).
; At least one localdir (incoming) is needed.
; incoming directory must be an absolute path

; remote repositories to search for data if not present in local directories
; repositories are given as list :
; Name = [protocol, server, port, [paths]]
; where protocol is one of the supported protocols :  local, ssh, http, https
; server and port are the server name and port to access the datas using the defined protocol
; and [paths] is a list of paths to search in the repository
; If credentials are required to access the repository, they should be given in the [credential] section using the same name
; repository CCIN2P3 is already defined in the database (so it's not necessary to define it here), but credentials for it have
; to be supplied in the [credentials] section below
; THIS DEFINITIONS OVERRIDE THE ONES FROM THE DATABASE

; Credentials for repositories given as :
; Name =  [user, keyfile]
; where name is the name of the repository
; This section allows you to specify your login and optionally a key file to access repositories or connect database though an ssh tunnel etc...
; For security reasons you will not be allowed to provide sensitive information as password in this file.
; If password is required (e.g. to decrypt the key file) it will be asked interactively.
; For ssh protocol, it's highly encouraged to use an ssh-agent (to avoid to have to provide passwd interactively at each run)
; To run an ssh-agent just do : `eval $(ssh-agent)` and `ssh-add .ssh/id_rsa`
