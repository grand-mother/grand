## motivation
In GRAND we want to be able to simulate air showers using both Zhaires and Coreas.
The _RawRoot_ file format is a step towards common output between CoREAS and ZHAireS. Its based on the _GRANDRoot_ file format.
The idea is for _RawRoot_ to be the starting point for the generation of _GRANDRoot_ files.

Common files are stored in the Common/ directory, Zharies specifics can be found in ZHAireSRawRoot/ and Coreas specifics in CoREASRawRoot/. 

# How to run Sim2Root
If you want to convert an air shower simulation to the _GRANDRoot_ file format, follow these steps:

*step 1:* convert air shower simulation to the _RawRoot_ file format\
For CoREAS follow the instructions under *1.a)*, for ZHAireS follow the instructions under *1.b)*.

*step 2:* convert your newly created _RawRoot_ file to the _GRANDRoot_ file format


## 1.a) CoREASRawRoot/CoreasToRawROOT.py
Here we have the scripts to produce _RawRoot_ files from CoREAS simulations.

To run the script on the provided example event just go to the CoREASRawRoot/ directory and do

`python3 CoreasToRawROOT.py GP13_000004/`

Alternatively, you can specify any other directory including a full CoREAS simulation.

[disclaimer:] only tested for Corsika7

*The output file will automatically be named "Coreas_" + < EventName > + ".root"*

## 1.b) ZHAireSRawRoot/ZHAireSRawToRawROOT.py
Here we have the scripts to produce _RawRoot_ files from ZHAireS simulations.

To run the script on the provided example event just go to the `ZHAireSRawRoot/` directory and either do:

`python3 ZHAireSRawToRawROOT.py InputDirectory Mode RunID EventID OutputFilename` (only standard mode is available)

 i.e.

`python3 ZHAireSRawToRawROOT.py ./GP300_Xi_Sib_Proton_3.8_51.6_135.4_1618 standard 0 1  GP300_1618.root`

or alternativelly

`python3 ZHAireSRawToRawROOT.py InputDirectory`

 i.e.

`python3 ZHAireSRawToRawROOT.py GP300_Xi_Sib_Proton_3.8_51.6_135.4_1618`

To let ZHAIRESRawToRawROOT make the choices for you. This is equivalent to running with RunID="SuitYourself", EventID="LookForIt", OutputFileName="GRANDConvention"	

## 2) Common/sim2root.py
Inside `Common/` you can find the final converter, `sim2root.py`

As input you need to give the ROOT file containing `RawRoot data TTrees`, as created with `CoreasToRawROOT` or `ZHAireSRawToRawROOT`.

i.e.

`python3 sim2root.py ../ZHAireSRawRoot/sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618/Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618.RawRoot -fo sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618`

additional options are available on command line, see sim2root --help for more information

# 3) Simulation Pipe example (note that this assumes one event per directoy, and is not working on files with more than 1 event)
You will find two scripts illustrating how to use RawRoot files as starting point of a simulation pipe are in the "Common" directory. 
Output File names are still not conforming to grand specifications. 

The example shows how to use the example RawRoot file given in /grand/sim2root/ZHAireSRawRoot/sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618 to produce the grandroot files including 
4 tvoltage files with the antenna response with and without the rf chain. You can use the RawRoot file of your liking.

## 3a) GenerateGRANDRoot
python /ProduceGRANDRoot.py InputDirectory OutputDirectory

python ProduceGRANDRoot.py  <your path here>/grand/sim2root/ZHAireSRawRoot/sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618 <your path here>/grand/sim2root/Common/sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618

## 3b) GenerateVoltage
python ProduceVoltage.py InputDirectory OutputDiectory

python <your path here>/grand/sim2root/Common/ProduceVoltage/ProduceVoltage.py <your path here>/grand/sim2root/Common/sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618 <your path here>/grand/sim2root/Common/sim_Xiaodushan_20221026_1200_1_SIBYLL23d_GP300_1618

Note that in this example we set the InputDiretory to be the same as the Outputdirectory to get all the files in the same place.
